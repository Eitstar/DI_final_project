             My name is Eitan, and after over five years in the high-tech industry, working at both startups and well-established companies, I have decided it is time to take on my over-due desire of becoming a full-stack web developer.
              </p>

 <p class="text-">
                 my journey of becoming a full-stack web developer has begun over a year ago, in which I mostly learned by a way of online courses. During this time, I realized, that by relying solely on online courses, I would lack acquiring the necessary tools for in-depth
                learning and specializing in the full-stack world.</p>
              <p class="text">Around three months ago, I’ve decided that it’s time to sign-up for an official frontal course that grants a diploma when finished. That BootCamp course, with over 350 hours of schooling, is three months voyage, that at its end I will
               become an official full-stack web developer. </p>
            <p class="text"> Now it is time to present you my portfolio, hope you would like it 👨‍💻 </p>
